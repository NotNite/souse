# souse

souse is a WIP experimental [XMPP](https://xmpp.org) client, with the focus of implementing the features required to replace centralized chat platforms. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), using [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and [React](https://react.dev).

souse is very unfinished. Do not expect a functional chat app.

## Goals

- Be maintainable, simple, sleek, and easy to onboard with.
- Support [one-on-one voice and video](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html), [conferencing](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html), [voice and video in conferencing](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0272.html).
